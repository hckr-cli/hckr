## Releasing Version/Tag
* Tags workflow [tags.yml](.github%2Fworkflows%2Ftags.yml) automatically creates tag using dynamic version defined in [__about__.py](src%2Fhckr%2F__about__.py)

## Publishing to Pypi
* Once we publish a release, Publish workflow [publish.yml](.github%2Fworkflows%2Fpublish.yml) automatically publishes a version to  [PyPi](https://pypi.org/p/hckr)

## Pre-commits
* we use pre-commits to make sure we only pushes if lint and other checks are passed.
* Install `pre-commit` from pypi and install in Git to enable this.
```bash 
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
